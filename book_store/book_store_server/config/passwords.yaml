# Use this file to store passwords to services that your server you use. When
# the server starts, the passwords will be automatically loaded and can be
# accessed from the `session.passwords` field. If you don't have access to a
# session object, passwords can also be accessed from
# `Serverpod.instance.passwords`. You can provide different passwords for
# different run configurations. If you want the same password for any
# configuration used, place it under `shared`.
#
# Note that this file should not be under version control. Store it in a safe
# place.

# Save passwords used across all configurations here.
